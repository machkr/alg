Input: 	n - number of integers in array
	A - array of n integers
	t - maximum size of a partition
	s - inequality score [t - p]^2

Partition A into partitions of size t or less

5     2     3     4     10     5     3

M[n, t] = min [ max(M[


5	2	3	4	10	5	3

(10 - 5)^2	10 - 7^2

25

Placing the (k - 1)th divider produces the kth partition,
resulting in a total cost equal to the cost of the last
partition and the cost of the partition to the left of
the divider.

if A[i] == t


Minimize the Maximum Total Cost
